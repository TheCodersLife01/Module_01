# Program 1

1. The input() function is used twice to capture two numerical values from the user. The prompts "Enter first number: " and "Enter second number: " guide the user to provide the necessary numerical inputs. The int() function converts the string input received from the user into integer data type for mathematical operations.
2. The program performs four basic mathematical operations using the input numbers:

Addition (+): Calculates the sum of num1 and num2

Subtraction (-): Calculates the difference between num1 and num2

Multiplication (*): Calculates the product of num1 and num2

Division (/): Calculates the quotient of num1 divided by num2

Each operation result is stored in a separate variable (add, subtract, multiply, divide) for clear organization and easy access.

3. The print() function outputs all calculation results using f-string formatting. This displays each operation with its corresponding result in a clean, readable format.

# Program 2

1. Input Handling: The input() function is used twice to capture the user's first name and last name. The prompts "Enter your first name: " and "Enter your last name: " guide the user to provide the necessary information.
2. Concatenation: The variables first_name and last_name are combined into full_name using the + operator, with a space inserted between them to ensure the full name is properly formatted.
3. Greeting Message: The print() function outputs the greeting message, which includes the full_name variable. This results in a personalized message such as "Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the python program." where "John Doe" is the full name provided by the user.
